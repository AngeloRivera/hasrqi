If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

a = sum ([3,6..999])
b = sum ([5,10..999])
d = sum [c | c <- [1..999], c `mod` 3 == 0 || c `mod` 5 ==0]
x = a+b
main = print $ x
